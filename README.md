Autism Detection Using Facial Features

Inspiration

The idea for this project arose from a heartfelt personal experience. In my locality, I observed a child whose behavior was noticeably different from their peers. This encounter made me think deeply about autism and the challenges faced by individuals on the Autism Spectrum.

It reminded me of the movie Taare Zameen Par, where the protagonist, Ishaan, struggles due to unrecognized learning and developmental differences. This powerful connection inspired me to explore how technology could help in the early detection of autism using facial features.

What Is Autism?

Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that impacts how individuals interact, communicate, and perceive the world around them.

Autism is a lifelong condition that varies in intensity across individuals. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for autistic individuals, helping them to better integrate into society, excel in their own unique ways, and lead fulfilling lives.

What We Are Building

We have developed an automated system for early autism detection using facial feature analysis. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system analyzes facial features to detect patterns associated with autism.

This system provides a diagnosis of whether a child is likely autistic or non-autistic. With its efficiency, accuracy, and user-friendly interface, it offers a valuable tool for parents, healthcare professionals, and educators.

Why Our Solution Is Better

Currently, diagnosing autism is a time-consuming process that involves observing a child's behavior over multiple sessions and consulting professionals. This can take weeks or even months.

Our system offers several advantages over traditional methods:

Faster Results: Reduces the time required for diagnosis.

Cost-Effective: Eliminates the need for multiple consultations.

Privacy-Oriented: Can be used discreetly in private settings.

Accurate and Reliable: Provides high accuracy using advanced ML techniques.

Implementation Details

1. Data Collection

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes labeled images categorized as autistic and non-autistic, providing a solid foundation for supervised learning.

2. Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for training:

Images were resized and rescaled for uniformity.

Data Augmentation was applied, creating variations such as rotations, flips, and shifts to enhance the dataset.

Tools like OpenCV were used for advanced image processing tasks.

3. Model Training

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition.

Steps Involved:

Keras Layers Integration: Layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout were used.

Training in Batches: Images were processed in batches for efficiency.

Epoch-Based Training: The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.94% over several epochs.

4. Deployment

To make the model accessible to users, we deployed it as a RESTful API using FastAPI.

Docker was used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent performance across different systems.

Dependencies such as NumPy, Pillow, and others were included to handle data processing and image manipulation tasks.

Key Technologies

Frameworks and Libraries

TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.

Keras: Simplifies neural network development.

FastAPI: For creating and deploying the REST API.

Docker: For containerization and deployment.

How It Works

Input: Users upload an image of the child.

Processing: The system preprocesses the image and uses the trained CNN model to analyze facial features.

Output: A diagnosis is provided, indicating whether the child is likely autistic or non-autistic.

Conclusion

This project represents a significant step toward using AI and ML in healthcare. By enabling faster, cost-effective, and accessible autism detection, this solution has the potential to revolutionize early diagnosis and intervention.

Like Ishaan in Taare Zameen Par, every child has unique potential. With the right tools and timely support, we can help them thrive.
